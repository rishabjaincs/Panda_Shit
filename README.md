# Panda_Shit
<div class="rich-text"><p>Pandas has so many uses that it might make sense to list the things it can't do instead of what it can do.</p><p>This tool is essentially your data’s home. Through pandas, you get acquainted with your data by cleaning, transforming, and analyzing it.</p><p>For example, say you want to explore a dataset stored in a CSV on your computer. Pandas will extract the data from that CSV into a DataFrame — a table, basically — then let you do things like:</p><ul><li>Calculate statistics and answer questions about the data, like<ul><li>What's the average, median, max, or min of each column?</li><li>Does column A correlate with column B?</li><li>What does the distribution of data in column C look like?</li></ul></li><li>Clean the data by doing things like removing missing values and filtering rows or columns by some criteria</li><li>Visualize the data with help from Matplotlib. Plot bars, lines, histograms, bubbles, and more.</li><li>Store the cleaned, transformed data back into a CSV, other file or database</li></ul><p>Before you jump into the modeling or the complex visualizations you need to have a good understanding of the nature of your dataset and pandas is the best avenue through which to do that.</p></div>
